        "When dawn breaks golden o'er the distant bay",
        "And morning's gentle fingers touch the light",
        "My heart recalls the love that slipped away",
        "Like stars that fade before the sun burns bright",
        "The roses bloom in gardens left behind",
        "Where once we walked beneath the ancient trees",
        "But exile's chains have cruelly confined",
        "My soul to wander far across the seas",
        "Yet still I dream of your beloved face",
        "Though mountains rise between us, cold and tall",
        "No distance can erase love's tender grace",
        "Nor silence break the bond that will not fall",
        "For love transcends all barriers of stone",
        "And finds its way to hearts that stand alone"

        "The exile walks a long and weary way",
        "Beneath the endless canvas of the night",
        "While memories of home begin to fray",
        "Like autumn leaves that drift beyond my sight",
        "The river flows where willows gently wind",
        "And nature whispers secrets to the breeze",
        "But I am lost, and cannot seem to find",
        "The path that leads to love and brings me ease",
        "In foreign lands I seek your gentle face",
        "Though oceans roar and tempests rise and fall",
        "My banished heart still knows its destined place",
        "Within your arms, beyond this prison's wall",
        "Though exiled far, my love remains full-grown",
        "A constant flame that burns for you alone"

      "lines": [
        "The songbird calls at ending of the day",
        "When shadows dance in fading crimson light",
        "And lovers meet where cherry blossoms stray",
        "While I stand banished in eternal night",
        "The oak tree stands where lovers' names are signed",
        "Its branches shelter those who wish to seize",
        "The fleeting joy that fate has not designed",
        "For exiled souls who sail on bitter seas",
        "I close my eyes and conjure up your face",
        "Though kingdoms crumble, empires rise and fall",
        "No tyrant's law can conquer love's embrace",
        "Nor break the vow I carved upon the wall",
        "From distant shores where I have long been thrown",
        "My love persists, unshaken and full-blown"

        "The seasons turn from green to ashen gray",

        "But love remains though I am forced to stray",
        "Beyond the hills where home once gleamed so bright",
        "The meadow blooms though I am far behind",
        "Where buttercups bow low to summer's tease",
        "And every flower speaks of love refined",
        "While I drift onward o'er these foreign seas",
        "O nature holds a mirror to your face",
        "In every stream and waterfall that fall",
        "The world reflects the beauty and the grace",
        "That haunts my dreams within this exile's thrall",
        "Though banished to this land of sand and bone",

        "I watch the sun make patterns as I lay",

        "That I return before the winter's bite",
        "The forest calls with songs I left behind",
        "Where songbirds nest among the swaying trees",
        "But exile's curse has left me deaf and blind",
        "To all but grief that rides upon the breeze",
        "I trace your features in the morning's grace",
        "Though years may pass and castles rise and fall",
        "No time can dim the memory of your face",

        "That love endures though separated by flight",
        "The mountain peak where eagles soar unconfined",
        "Stands sentinel above the verdant leas",
        "But I am trapped by fate that proved unkind",
        "And wanders exile's path across the seas",
        "The sunset paints the heavens with your face",
        "Though iron bars and soldiers guard the wall",
        "My spirit finds you in this sacred place",

        "The ivy clings to walls that time resigned",
        "And testament to nature's power to please",
        "While I recall the joy I left behind",
        "In gardens sweet beyond these restless seas",

        "The forest path where lovers walked combined",
        "Now overgrown with thorns that twist and squeeze",
        "The life from all the beauty left behind",
        "While I am tossed on unforgiving seas",

        "Among the roses and the willow trees",
        "But now those grounds are lost, and I am pined",
